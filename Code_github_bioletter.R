# As most of the analyses use bayesian and mcmc chains sampling, running all the script 
# will take time, so select parts that you want to use, 
# or reduce the number of MCMC chanels (it can however increases variability). 
# Finally, as the method use mcmc chains sampling, you will never found twice the same results 
# by runnig twice the same analysis. Nevertheless, results are always extremely close to those 
# found in the article, and include in the credibility intervals.
