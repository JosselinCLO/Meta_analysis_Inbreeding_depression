# Meta_analysis_Inbreeding_depression

These code and data have been used to generate the result section of the manuscript 'Inbreeding depression in polyploid species: a meta-analysis', by Clo & Kolar
(accepted in Biology Letters). If you find any mistake, or have any queries, please contact me at: josselin.clo@gmail.com.

It contains:

- The dataset used, the dataset includes:
  * The species' name
  * The family of plants
  * The name of the populations used in the articles
  * The trait under study 
  * Inbreeding depression estimates for the trait under study for each cytotype (ID diploid, ID synthetic, ID tetraploid)
  * The ratio of inbreeding depression of diploids over synthetics or tetraploids (ratio_diplo_neo or ratio_diplo_tetra)
  * A selfing rate estimate for diploids and polyploids (selfing_diplo, selfing_poly)
  * The origin of polyploids (poly_type = auto- or allo-polyploids)
  * The name of the species formated for the phylogenetic analysis (phylo_corr)
  * The reference of the article
  
- The phylogenetic tree of sampled species
- The Rcode used to perform the analyses.
